## Repository state
  <sub><sup>ðŸŸ¢</sup></sub> Active

Repository was created as a starting point for my own projects that in normal case uses Svelte. Lately i have been switching over to Astro and in need of a starting point with [Skeleton UI](https://www.skeleton.dev/), as i could not find any decided to create my own. There are more updates to be done until it can be set as a more complete theme but it is ready as a starting point.
